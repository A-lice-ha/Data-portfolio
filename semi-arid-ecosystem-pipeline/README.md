# 🌿 Semi-Arid Ecosystem Monitoring Pipeline

Custom R pipeline for the geospatial assessment and site selection in Indian semi-arid ecosystems. This project was part of my research as a Project Assistant at IISc.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- R: tidyverse, raster, sf
- Google Earth Engine
- Google Earth Pro

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Harmonized NDVI, LST, and elevation datasets
2. Built automated R pipelines to preprocess spatial data
3. Conducted site selection using environmental thresholds
4. Validated >50 sites manually and semi-automatically
5. Reduced runtime by ~67% through automation

## 🔍 Outputs
*(Add site selection maps or .tif previews here)*

## 📂 Files
