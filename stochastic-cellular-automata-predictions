## ðŸŒ± Stochastic Cellular Automata for Vegetation Dynamics  
**Language:** R  
**Type:** Simulation Project | Spatial Ecology

Developed a stochastic cellular automaton to simulate vegetation dynamics on a 2D grid. The model captures how local interactions and stochastic processes influence vegetation spread and mortality over time.

**Highlights:**
- Initialized a 50Ã—50 spatial grid representing vegetated (1) and bare-ground (0) cells.
- Used Von Neumann neighborhood (top, bottom, left, right) to evaluate local cell interactions.
- Implemented probabilistic growth and death rules:
  - Growth: Bare ground transitions to vegetation with increasing probability based on vegetated neighbors.
  - Death: Vegetation dies with probability influenced by surrounding vegetation density.
- Simulated over 100 time steps, storing temporal states for dynamic visualization.
- Visualized spatial outcomes using base R graphics.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
Stochastic modeling â€¢ Spatial simulation â€¢ Ecological dynamics â€¢ R scripting â€¢ Matrix operations â€¢ Visualization
